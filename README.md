# Maze Generator & Solver

## Overview
This program generates a solvable maze and then finds the shortest path from the entrance to the exit using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The maze and its solution are visualized in the console.

## Algorithms

### Maze Generation
The program creates a simple maze by carving a path from the entrance to the exit.

### Maze Solving - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is a classic graph traversal algorithm. For our maze, it explores all potential paths to ensure the shortest one is found. BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes, ensuring a layer-by-layer exploration.
